# Cookery
Cookery is an application in Swift for iOS. 

The application stores recipes and recipe notes on your phone.
It accomplishes this using a table view where each cell of the table is a recipe.

Within each cell, the table stores the name of a dish and a dish category.
It also saves a picture from the camera.
The picture in the detail view is used to capture the recipe or notes itself.
For example, one could photograph a hand written recipe, a recipe from a cookbook, or a magazine. 

The user is presented options in the home screen to add and remove recipes.
The recipe data and images are stored on the phone in the apps sandbox.

This application is a very roughed out, yet functional, early implementation.
There are many things to do to make it a better application.

- Ability to add a picture of the dish and display it in the table view
- Improve the camera launch UX so that it is better able to handle the multiple images per record
- Allow the dish category to be selected from a pre-populated list of categories
- Add a search function
- Add a sort function
- Add a splash screen
- Implement rotation and landscape modes
- Provide better visuals
- Add analytics
- Add cloud based storage

And more to come
